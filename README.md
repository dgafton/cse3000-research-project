# Identifying non-monotonicity in Empirical Learning Curves using performance differences

This repository contains all the code to run experiments and generate plots for the *Prevalence of non-monotonicity in empirical learning curves* research project. This paper has been produced as part of the CSE3000 - Research Project course at Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands.

This research builds on top of the LCDB repository, which can be found [here](https://github.com/fmohr/lcdb).

### 1. Install dependencies
Python 3.9, Anaconda and Pip are required to run the experiments. Run the first cell of any Experiment notebook to install all the packages used in the project. Run it ONLY the first time or whenever you encounter errors while importing modules.


### 2. Running the Experiments
To run the experiments, first open the Jupyter Notebook file in any IDE of your choice (i.e PyCharm) or in any browser using Anaconda. Simply run the cells in the notebook to get the experimental results.

**Note:** Running experiment 3 requires access to the algorithm of Codrin Socol, found [here](https://github.com/CodrinSocol/cse3000-research-project). The results can be replicated by re-running Experiment3.ipynb and comparing the output to the results of Codrin Socol, found in file "Socol_algorithm_results.csv".
